title: Exploring datasets with statistics and scatterplots 
summary: "Often, one or more data pre-processing step(s) may be required to proceed with the analysis. 
And, after the analysis, maybe you would like to visualize the result or datasets"

The Iris flower data set, also known as Fisher’s or Anderson’s Iris data set, 
is a multivariate dataset introduced by the British statistician and biologist 
Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper ([Fisher 1936](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1469-1809.1936.tb02137.x)). 
Each row of the table represents an iris flower sample, 
describing its species and the dimensions in centimeters of its botanical parts, the sepals and petals.

## Pre-Processing
The tools we will use require tab-separated input data and assume there is no header line. 
Since our data is comma-separated and has a header line, 
we will have to perform the following pre-processing steps to prepare it for the actual analysis:

* Format conversion
* Header removal

### Format conversion
1. Convert <span class="fa fa-fw fa-pencil"></span> the CSV file (comma-separated values) to tabular format (tsv; tab-separated values)
   * In the central panel, click on the <span class="fa fa-fw fa-gear"></span> **Convert** tab on the top \
   * In the upper part <span class="fa fa-fw fa-gear"></span> **Convert**  select `tabular (using csv-to-tabular)`
   * Click the **Create dataset** button to start the conversion.
2. Rename <span class="fa fa-fw fa-pencil"></span> the resulting dataset to `iris tabular`
3. View <span class="fa fa-fw fa-eye"></span> the generate file

### Header removal
1. Use the tools search box at the top of the tool panel to find `Remove beginning`
2. `Remove beginning` with the following parameters: 
   - *Remove first:* 1 (to remove the first line only)
   - <span class="fa fa-fw fa-file"></span> *from*: select the `iris tabular` file from your history
   - **Execute**
   ![]({{site.url}}/images/remove_beginning.png)
3. Rename <span class="fa fa-fw fa-pencil"></span> the resulting dataset to `iris clean`
4. View <span class="fa fa-fw fa-eye"></span> the generate file

<span class="fa fa-fw fa-question-circle"></span> **Question**
- How many samples (lines) does our dataset contain?

## Data Analysis: What does the dataset contain?

---

### How many different species are in the dataset?
In order to answer this question, we will have to look at column 5 of our file, and count how many different values (species) appear there.  There are several ways we could do this in Galaxy.

#### Extract species
One approach might be to first extract this column from the file, and then count how many unique lines the file contains. 
1. `Cut columns from a table` with the following parameters: 
   * *Cut columns*: c5
   * *Delimited by*: tab
   * <span class="fa fa-fw fa-file"></span> *From*: select the `iris clean` file from your history
2. Rename <span class="fa fa-fw fa-pencil"></span> the resulting dataset to `iris species column`
3. View <span class="fa fa-fw fa-eye"></span> the generate file
4. `Unique occurrences of each record`  with the following parameters:
   * <span class="fa fa-fw fa-file"></span> *File to scan for unique values*: select the `iris species coulumn` file from your history
5. Rename <span class="fa fa-fw fa-pencil"></span> the resulting dataset to `iris species`
6. View <span class="fa fa-fw fa-eye"></span> the generate file

<span class="fa fa-fw fa-question-circle"></span> **Question**
1. How many different species are in the dataset? 
2. What are the different Iris species? 

#### Grouping dataset
1. Try answering this question (how many Iris species are in the file?) again, using a different approach: 
2. Did you get the same answer as before? 
3. Rename <span class="fa fa-fw fa-pencil"></span> the resulting dataset to `iris species group`

<p style="text-align:right"><a href="{{site.url}}{{page.url}}"><strong>Go Up</strong><span class="fa fa-fw fa-arrow-up"></span></a></p>
---

### How many samples by species are in the dataset?
Now that we know that there are 3 different species in our dataset, our next objective is determining how many samples 
of each species we have. To answer this, we need to look at column 5 again, 
but instead of just determining how many unique values there are, we need to count how many times each of them occurs.

1. **Re-run** <span class="fa fa-fw fa-again"></span> the `Group` tool with the following parameters: 
   * <span class="fa fa-fw fa-file"></span> *Select data*: `iris clean`
   * *Group by column*: Column: 5
   * *Insert operation*: 
     * *Type*: Count
     * *On Column*: 1
2. Rename <span class="fa fa-fw fa-pencil"></span> the resulting dataset to `iris samples per species group`
3. View <span class="fa fa-fw fa-eye"></span> the generate file

<span class="fa fa-fw fa-question-circle"></span> **Question**
- How many samples per species are in the dataset?

## Analysis: How to differentiate the different Iris species?

We know that we have 3 species of iris flowers, with 50 samples for each:

* setosa 
* versicolor 
* virginica

![]({{site.url}}/images/iris_flowers.png)

Our aim is to find out whether the features we have been given for each species can help us to highlight the differences between the 3 species.

In our dataset, we have the following features measured for each sample:

* Petal length 
* Petal width 
* Sepal length 
* Sepal width

# Galaxy Management

---

## Convert your analysis history into a workflow
1. Follow the [instructions from the previous lecture]({{site.url}}/lectures/03.introduction_to_galaxy_analyses/#convert-your-analysis-history-into-a-workflow)
2. Replace the Workflow name to something more descriptive, for example: `Exploring Iris dataset with statistics and scatterplots.`
3. Click on **Workflow** in the top menu of Galaxy.

    ![]({{site.url}}/images/iris_workflow_list.png)

## The workflow editor
1. Open the **workflow editor**
   * Click on the dropdown menu <span class="fa fa-fw fa-caret-down"></span> to the right of your workflow name.
2. Select **Edit** to launch the workflow editor. 
   ![]({{site.url}}/images/iris_workflow_editor.png)
    * When you click on a workflow step, you will get a view of all the parameter settings for that tool on the right-hand side of your screen (the **Details** section)
    * You can also change the parameter settings of your workflow here, and also do more advanced configuration.
3. Hiding intermediate outputs
    * By default, all outputs will be shown
    * Click the *checkbox* next to the outputs to mark them as important: 
      * **outfile** in `Unique` step
      * **out_file1** in `Group` step
      * **png** in both `Scatterplot w ggplot2` steps
      * Now, when we run the workflow, we will only see these final outputs 
4. Renaming output datasets
    * Let’s rename the outputs we marked as important with the checkbox (and thus do not hide) to more meaningful names:
      *  `Unique` tool, output **outfile**: rename to **categories**
      *  `Group` tool, output **out_file1**: rename to **samples per category** 
      * Rename the scatterplot outputs as well, remember to choose a generic name, since we can now also run this on data other than iris plants.
   ![]({{site.url}}/images/workflow_rename_datasets.png)
5. **Save your workflow** (important!) by clicking on the <span class="fa fa-fw fa-save"></span> icon at the top right of the screen.
6. Return to the analysis view by clicking on the Home icon <span class="fa fa-fw fa-home"></span> (or **Analyze Data** on older Galaxy versions) at the top menu bar.

<p style="text-align:right"><a href="{{site.url}}{{page.url}}"><strong>Go Up</strong><span class="fa fa-fw fa-arrow-up"></span></a></p>

## Run workflow on different data

Now that we have built our workflow, let’s use it on some different data. For example, let us explore the `diamonds` dataset
The original dataset consists of 53940 specimen of diamonds, for which it lists the prices and various properties. 
For this training, we have created a simpler dataset from the original, in which only the five columns relating to 
the price and the so-called 4 Cs (carat, cut, color and clarity) of diamond characteristics have been retained.

* Carat refers to the weight of the diamond when measured on a scale 
* Cut refers to the quality of the cut and can take the grades Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium and Ideal 
* Color describes the overall tint, or lack thereof, of the diamond from colorless/white to yellow and is given on a letter scale ranging from D to Z (D being the best, known as colorless). 
* Clarity describes the amount and location of naturally occuring “inclusions” found in nearly all diamonds on a scale of eleven grades ranging from Flawless (the ideal situation) to I3 (Included level 3, the worst quality).

### Starter Pack
1. Create a new History
2. Rename your history to be meaningful and easy to find. 
3. Upload the Iris dataset `diamons.csv` 
    ```shell 
    https://zenodo.org/record/3540705/files/diamonds.csv
    ```
4. View <span class="fa fa-fw fa-eye"></span> the dataset
5. Rename <span class="fa fa-fw fa-pencil"></span> the dataset to `diamond`
6. Add an `#diamond` tag <span class="fa fa-fw fa-tag"></span> to the dataset

### Run workflow
1. Open the workflow menu (top menu bar), Find the workflow you made in the previous section and Select the option **Run**.
2. Select the `diamonds` dataset as the input dataset.
3. Customize the first scatter plot:
4. Customize the second scatter plot.
5. Click **Run workflow**.
6. Once the workflow has started, you will initially be able to see all its steps, but the unimportant intermediates will disappear after they complete successfully

<span class="fa fa-fw fa-question-circle"></span> **Question**
1. How many cut category are there in the Diamond dataset ? 
2. How many samples are there in each cut category ? 
3. What do you notice about the relationship between price and carat ? 
4. Based on the plot showing Price vs. Carat with Clarity as a factor, do you think clarity accounts for some of the variance in price? Why ?
